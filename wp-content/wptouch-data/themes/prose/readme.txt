Prose was beautifully designed to showcase content— if you're a writer, or the focus of your website is sharing great content, Prose was designed to make it shine it on mobile. Prose features unique article time remaining functionality, and unique sharing options when readers finish your articles. A simple off-canvas menu also allows visitors to change text reading size, view collections or categories of content, and more.
